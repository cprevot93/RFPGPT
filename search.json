Actions that can be taken include Monitor, Block, Reset and Quarantine along with packet capture for any signature hit.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>L3 and L4 anomalies applied at an interface level for things like sync, sctp, icmp floods, port scans, source and destination sessions are there too.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The FortiGuard Intrusion Prevention Service provides Fortinet customers with the latest defenses against stealthy network-level threats. It uses a customizable database of more than 8000+ known threats to enable FortiGate appliances to stop attacks that evade conventional firewall defenses. It also provides behavior-based heuristics, enabling the system to recognize threats for which no signature has yet been developed.&nbsp; &nbsp;These service updates such as IPS and Malware updates are non-service affecting; meaning they are updated and restarted automatically in the background without disrupting traffic flow. When deployed in a high-availability active/passive cluster, firmware updates are performed in sequence so that the alternate cluster member remains online, ensuring maximum network availability with zero downtime. IPS signatures are downloaded on a configurable schedule (hours to days) either directly from the FortiGuard Distribution Network (FDN) via the Internet or from a FortiManager which becomes part of the FDN.</div><div><br></div><div>IPS security profiles are configured on traffic policies. Thus if a traffic policy exists for inbound communications from the Internet and an IPS security profile is assigned to it then the traffic is inspected. If the question asks the order of inspection (firewall first, then IPS), the traffic must match a policy before it is inspected by any IPS security profile attached to that traffic policy. If the traffic matches no policy, it is dropped. If a match occurs and there is an IPS security profile assigned to it, then it is scanned.</div><div><br></div><div>The FortiGate can be configured for IPS in an L2 mode using virtual-wire pairs or transparent mode. &nbsp;The IPS engine can be configured for fail-open. &nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Approximately 70 new signatures are released on a weekly basis and downloaded to either the FortiGate devices or a FortiManager console.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>All FortiGuard IPS Service Updates can be viewed in detail at www.fortiguard.com/updates/ips</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Custom IPS Signatures are supported. The application control and IPS signatures provide coverage for most applications and network vulnerabilities. You can extend the coverage by adding custom application signatures and custom IPS signatures.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Each packet is a capable of having the header and payload inspected.

FortiOS implements sFlow and Netflow version 9. sFlow and Netflow uses packet sampling to monitor network traffic. The sFlow and Netflow Agent captures packet information at defined intervals and sends them to an sFlow and Netflow Collector for analysis, providing real-time data analysis. The information sent is only a sampling of the data for minimal impact on network throughput and performance. The sFlow and Netflow Agent is embedded in the FortiGate unit. Once configured, the FortiGate unit sends sFlow and Netflow datagrams of the sampled traffic to the sFlow and Netflow Collector also called a sFlow and Netflow Analyzer. The sFlow and Netflow Collector receives the datagrams and provides real-time analysis and graphing to indicate where potential traffic issues are occurring. sFlow and Netflow Collector software is available from a number of third-party software vendors. sFlow and Netflow data captures only a sampling of network traffic, not all traffic like the traffic logs on the FortiGate unit. Sampling works by the sFlow and Netflow Agent looking at traffic packets when they arrive on an interface. A decision is made whether the packet is dropped and allowed to be its destination or if a copy is forwarded to the sFlow and Netflow Collector.
